# movies-room

Example Android application with [Room DB](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) persistant storage and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html) with [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) from Android Architecture Components. All code is written in Kotlin.
